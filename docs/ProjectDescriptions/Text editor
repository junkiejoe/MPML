The text editor project is a basic editing tool that can edit text, and supports basic syntax highlighting.

Using a library is encouraged, as there is no way apart of the C library to interact with the console.
The list of keywords tokens to highlight should match the keywords from the implementation language.
The keywords should be colored green (0, 255, 0), and text colored white.

The editor should support:
- System clipboard
- Copy paste (Control-c, Control-v)
- Quit (C-q)
- Navigation (arrows, home, end)
