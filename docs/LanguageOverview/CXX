Pros:

- Supported on every major platform.
- Has cppreference, a great reference to discover features and understand the language.
- 
Cons:

- HORRIBLE, GARBAGE, WORTHLESS compile times.
- The WORST tooling of ANY programming language.
- Every feature except the ones you need.
- Null terminated strings instead of length prefixed.
- Have to work with two different major compilers (cl and clang).
- Many libraries use templates which RUINS compile times.
- Removes useful features from C99 (for no benefit), and refuses to add features from newer C versions (#embed).
- Module system with no standard binary interface, so have fun getting LSP setup with different compilers.
- CMake STILL considers modules experimental (even when this no longer becomes true, it took FOREVER).

This is a horrible language. Every time you try and use something from the standard library, there WILL be an issue you have with it.
There are ONLY 2 reasons to use this language.

1. You are targetting multiple platforms. Especially gaming consoles
2. You need to use some C/C++ library.
