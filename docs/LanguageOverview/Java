* Documentation

Java is well-documentated.
Every library had information on exceptions that may be thrown.


* Pros, cons, and considerations

Pros:

- Java makes it very easy to come from C and C++
- Module system (package, import)
- Better tooling than C and C++ (low bar)
- Better, cleaner standard library than C++.

Cons:

- IO is limited compared to C and C++

Considerations:

- Java is an OOP based language.
- The language is garbage collected, which can be a no-go for certain programs.
