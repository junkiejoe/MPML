# MPML - Multiple Projects, Multiple (programming ) Languages

The purpose of this project is to determine the strength and weaknesses of programming languages and their tooling.
Some languages like JVM-based languages and C are not included because they are not different enough to consider.

Projects implementations are free to use any external library, as this is both a comparison of the language and the tooling.
If, for any given language, multiple libraries have been shown to inconvenient to setup/use,
it should be factored as "con" in language overviews.

Documentation / notes are stored in the "docs" directory.
Reviews of languages are stored in docs/LanguageOverview.

 > A check marks a completed project.

As of November 13, 2025, the currently planned/implemented projects are:
- [ ] An auto complete engine
- [ ] A terminal text editor
- [ ] A 3D renderer
